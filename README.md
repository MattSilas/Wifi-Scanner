Wifiscan runs on Windows and OSX. 

The API returns a JSON object. It is merely for demonstartion purposes and provides a quick template for parsing the scanner's output. Configure it to suit your own applications.

Feel free to add Linux (iwlist -scanning) support and I will accept accept the merge after review, however I will not be adding a Linux scanning utility.
